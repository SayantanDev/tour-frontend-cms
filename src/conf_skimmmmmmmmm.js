We will need to complete our entry formalities here. You will need to pay for a camera permit here if you are carrying any. Your trek guide will help you through the process. The Singalila National Park houses a great number of animals like the Himalayan Bear, Leopard cat, Barking Dear, Pangolin and the famous and elusive Red Panda. We will have a relaxed flat walk till we reach the settlement of Jaubari. All along the way, our trail will flirt with the Indo-Nepal border as we criss cross through our neighbor lands. From Jaubari we will have a descent, till we reach Gairibas. Here you can have a small break and also indulge in some snacks. Gairibas houses a rhododendron research centre and has a detailed accounting of the various varieties of Rhododendrons available in the region. From Gairibas we will face the first difficult phase of our trek, as we traverse a steep climb all the way to Kalipokhari. After a strenuous but rewarding climb, we will reach the high altitude lake of Kalipokhari.
