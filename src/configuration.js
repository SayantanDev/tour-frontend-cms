You wile ride through meadows and rhododendron forests as you gradually climb to your destintion. On the way the hamlets of Chitrey and Meghma will welcome you. You can have a small tea break at Chitrey, before you continue journey. From Meghma, its just 2 km to Tonglu and is the steepest part of the trail. Once reaching Tonglu, you will be mesmerized with the surreal view all around you. There is also the choice of proceeding to Tumling, just 1 Km farther, which houses somewhat better accommodation choices. After reaching your destination and settling down, you will be served with hot lunch. After that you can set out to explore the area. On a clear day, Tonglu boasts of a magnificent view of the Sleeping Buddha Range. There are small hillocks you can climb and take some envy enducing photos to show back home. As the day comes to close, the temperature drops considerably and you will have to move indoors. You can spend the evening, chatting away with the locals and enjoying the tasty local drink, Thumba. Soon, dinner will be ready for you and you can take to bed as you can’t miss the sunrise tomorrow.</p>"

We will need to complete our entry formalities here. You will need to pay for a camera permit here if you are carrying any. Your trek guide will help you through the process. The Singalila National Park houses a great number of animals like the Himalayan Bear, Leopard cat, Barking Dear, Pangolin and the famous and elusive Red Panda. We will have a relaxed flat walk till we reach the settlement of Jaubari. All along the way, our trail will flirt with the Indo-Nepal border as we criss cross through our neighbor lands. From Jaubari we will have a descent, till we reach Gairibas. Here you can have a small break and also indulge in some snacks. Gairibas houses a rhododendron research centre and has a detailed accounting of the various varieties of Rhododendrons available in the region. From Gairibas we will face the first difficult phase of our trek, as we traverse a steep climb all the way to Kalipokhari. After a strenuous but rewarding climb, we will reach the high altitude lake of Kalipokhari. After a steaming hot beverage to soothe your aching muscles, you can pay a visit to the calm waters of the lake and feel your tiredness ebbing away.</p>"

The Singalila National Park houses a great number of animals like the Himalayan Bear, Leopard cat, Barking Dear, Pangolin and the famous and elusive Red Panda. We will have a relaxed flat walk till we reach the settlement of Jaubari. All along the way, our trail will flirt with the Indo-Nepal border as we criss cross through our neighbor lands. From Jaubari we will have a descent, till we reach Gairibas. Here you can have a small break and also indulge in some snacks. Gairibas houses a rhododendron research centre and has a detailed accounting of the various varieties of Rhododendrons available in the region. From Gairibas we will face the first difficult phase of our trek, as we traverse a steep climb all the way to Kalipokhari. After a strenuous but rewarding climb, we will reach the high altitude lake of Kalipokhari. After a steaming hot beverage to soothe your aching muscles, you can pay a visit to the calm waters of the lake and feel your tiredness ebbing away.</p>"
